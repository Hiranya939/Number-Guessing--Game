🎯 Project Overview: Number Guessing System

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as input handling, conditional logic, loops, and random number generation. The system generates a random number within a specified range, and the user attempts to guess the number through a series of inputs. After each guess, the system provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

🔧 Key Features

a. Random number generation within configurable range

b. User input handling with validation

c. Real-time feedback on guesses

d. Attempt tracking

e. Optional difficulty levels (if implemented)

📌 Objectives

a. Practice core programming constructs in a real-world mini-project

b. Develop a basic CLI (Command-Line Interface) interactive application

c. Demonstrate clean code structure and documentation for beginner-friendly learning

d. Provide a lightweight, extendable base for further enhancements (e.g., GUI, scoring system, multiplayer mode)
✅ Features & Functionality
🎲 Random Number Generation

e. Generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

f. Range can be easily adjusted in the code (or via user input if supported).

🎮 User Interaction

a. Prompts the user to guess the number.

b. Accepts user input through a command-line or text-based interface.

c. Provides feedback after each guess:

"Too high"

"Too low"

"Correct!"

🔁 Attempt Tracking

a. Keeps track of the number of attempts made.

b.Displays total number of guesses after the game ends.

⚙️ Difficulty Levels (optional)

a. Allows selection of difficulty (e.g., Easy: 1–50, Hard: 1–500).

b. Affects the range of random numbers and possibly the number of allowed attempts.

❌ Input Validation

a. Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric or out-of-range values).

b. Prevents crashes due to bad input by using error handling.

📊 Score / Performance Summary (optional)

a. Displays stats like:

b. Number of attempts

c. Time taken (if implemented)

d. High score or best performance (if saved)

🔄 Play Again Option

After the game ends, the user is asked if they want to play again.

🧩 Modular Code Structure

a. Organized functions (e.g., generate_number(), get_user_guess(), check_guess())

b. Easy to modify or extend (e.g., add GUI, multiplayer mode)

🧠 Implementation Details (C++)

🔧 Tools Used

a. Language: C++

b. Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MSVC)

c. Libraries: <iostream>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>

📌 Features Implemented

a. Random number generation

b. User input and validation

c. Guess feedback ("Too high", "Too low", "Correct")

d. Attempt counter

e. Play again option

✅ Output Features Demonstrated

a. Input validation for non-numeric and out-of-range input

b. Dynamic hints: "Too high", "Too low"

c. Correct guess feedback with total attempts

d. Option to replay the game
